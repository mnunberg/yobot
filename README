Yobot is a multi-protocol multi-user messenger relay with a plugin system.

This is not an IRC bouncer, nor is it a normal instant messaging client -
though this does include the functionality of both. If you are looking for an
IRC bouncer, there are many out there. If you are looking for a normal, full
featured IM client, use Pidgin

The following features have been at least moderately implemented:

(1): The ability to sign in from multiple locations while not being signed
out from other locations. Some protocols (oscar/AIM and jabber) support this
while others (such as yahoo or MSN) do not. The caveat is that you must use
the included client (or any client which speaks the Yobot protocol, which 
as of writing, is only the included client).

(2): Centralized Logging and 'offline' messaging. Using the client, you can
query the server for message history, and also get any messages received 
in a period when no other client was connected

(3): A plugin system: ./py/yobot_interfaces.py has interface definitions for
writing your own plugin. The basic methods include connecting to a server,
joining a chatroom, and receiving/sending messages.

(4): A very comprehensive trivia bot which reads to an SQLite database (see
source), and optionally writes to the database in an attempt to prevent the 
same questions from appearing again. Also implemented is an anagrams feature
which will scramble a list of words (also from a database). -- written in PyQt

(5): A graphical client written in PyQt, supports basic html formatting, smileys,
and buddy icons. Can also set your status for each account separately. The UI 
was designed to be simple.

Yobot does not do any IM protocol handling. If you cannot connect to your 
account, most likely something is wrong with libpurple or the protocol
server.

Also note that this is extremely alpha quality software, many things will still
not work
